# consPairLists

Javascript assignment problems which focus on functional programming and code clarity.

In pairs, we generalize the cons function to create a list with 2 elements, which can be further nested. For example, you can create 
var list = cons(1, cons(2, cons(3, cons(4, null)))); which is a list that can be accessed with functions car (returns the first element of list) 
or cdr (second element of the list). 

Because we can nest cons structures, both car and cdr can return other lists as well.
